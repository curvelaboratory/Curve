Function Calling (Agentic) Apps
===============================

Building something more than a summary/qa experience requires giving users access to you data and APIs - via prompts. 
Curve enables that use case by offering a capability called "Function Calling". Curve extracts critical imformation 
from a prompt and can match the intent of the user to an API or business function hosted in your application.
