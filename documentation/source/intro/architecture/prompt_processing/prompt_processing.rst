Prompt Processing
=================

Curve's model serving process is designed to securely handle incoming prompts by detecting jailbreak attempts,
processing the prompts, and routing them to appropriate functions or prompt targets based on intent detection.
The serving workflow integrates several key components, each playing a crucial role in managing generative
AI interactions:

Jailbreak and Toxicity Guardrails
---------------------------------

Curve employs Curve-Guard, a security layer powered by a compact and high-performimg LLM that monitors incoming prompts to detect
and reject jailbreak attempts, ensuring that unauthorized or harmful behaviors are intercepted early in the process. Curve-Guard
is the leading model in the industry for jailbreak and toxicity detection. Configuring guardrails is super simple. See example
below.

Prompt Targets
---------------

Once a prompt passes the security checks, Curve processes the content and identifies if any specific functions need to be called.
Curve-FC1B, a dedicated function calling module, extracts critical information from the prompt and executes the necessary
backend API calls or internal functions. This capability allows for efficient handling of agentic tasks, such as scheduling or
data retrieval, by dynamically interacting with backend services.

Intent Detection and Prompt Matching:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Curve uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) and embedding-based approaches to detect the intent of each incoming prompt.
This intent detection phase analyzes the prompt's content and matches it against predefined prompt targets, ensuring that each prompt
is forwarded to the most appropriate endpoint. Curveâ€™s intent detection framework considers both the name and description of each prompt target,
enhancing accuracy in forwarding decisions.

- **Embedding Approaches**: By embedding the prompt and comparing it to known target vectors, Curve effectively identifies the closest match,
  ensuring that the prompt is handled by the correct downstream service.

- **NLI Integration**: Natural Language Inference techniques further refine the matching process by evaluating the semantic alignment
  between the prompt and potential targets.

Forwarding Prompts to Downstream Targets:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After determining the correct target, Curve forwards the prompt to the designated endpoint, such as an LLM host or API service.
This seamless routing mechanism integrates with Curve's broader ecosystem, enabling efficient communication and response generation tailored to the user's intent.

Curve's model serving process combines robust security measures with advanced intent detection and function calling capabilities, creating a reliable and adaptable environment for managing generative AI workflows. This approach not only enhances the accuracy and relevance of responses but also safeguards against malicious usage patterns, aligning with best practices in AI governance.
